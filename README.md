This repo contains the code used to create a project for my business systems and analytics class on Olympic Trends. The data was originally collected by Kaggle user RGRIFFEN, which you can find here \href{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results}{here}
